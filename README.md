# Careeer-Foundry-Data-Analytics-Program-Python-Project-
This project was part of the Career Foundry Data Analytics program and utilized public datasets from Instacart as well as fictional datasets about Instacart customers in order to learn and apply Python essentials for performing initial data and exploratory analysis in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation. 

## Context 
For this project I played the role of an Instacart Data Analyst assisting stakeholders to explore possible customer segmentation in consideration of a targeted marketing strategy. The analysis helped to inform stakeholders what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacar targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products. 

## Data 
* Customers Data Set (fictional data on Instacart customers created by Career Foundry for the purpose of the learning project)
* Data Dictionary
* The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset
